I *love* working on open source geospatial projects! From the field collection to the software development to the analysis and visualization, and most things in between, it just makes me happy to work on this stuff. Some might say, a "passion"?

The more and more I work on open source geo projects over the years, the more and more I become convinced: I want open source geo to be a huge part of my life!

I'm so grateful for the community that has provided me so much good quality codez and datas for which to work on for my projects, and I figure the best way to show my gratitude would be to pay it forward.

So, I decided to create my own brand for open source geospatial projects -- geoDavey -- to contribute back to the community and hopefully be to someone's benefit by sharing codez, project details and inspiration.
